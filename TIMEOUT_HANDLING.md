# Timeout Handling and Progress Saving Implementation

## Overview

This implementation addresses issue #11 by ensuring that all operations that might be subject to timeouts have proper progress saving, status reporting, and recovery mechanisms. The solution provides comprehensive protection against data loss and clear user feedback.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Export Operations with Progress Tracking

**Files Modified:**
- `src/utils/export.js` - Added async progress tracking to all export functions
- `src/pages/Reports.jsx` - Integrated progress notifications for exports
- `src/components/ProgressNotification.jsx` - New component for operation progress

**Improvements:**
- **Chunked Processing**: Large datasets are processed in chunks to prevent browser timeouts
- **Progress Callbacks**: Real-time progress updates during export operations
- **Timeout Handling**: 60-second timeout with automatic recovery
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of blob URLs and objects
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful error handling with user feedback

**Example Usage:**
```javascript
// Export now provides progress feedback
const result = await exportToCSV(data, filename, (progress, message) => {
  console.log(`${progress}%: ${message}`);
});
```

### 2. Operation Status Management

**Files Created:**
- `src/utils/operationStatus.js` - Hooks for managing operation progress and timeouts
- `src/components/StatusNotification.jsx` - Global status notification system

**Features:**
- **Timeout Protection**: Configurable timeouts with automatic progress saving
- **Status Feedback**: Real-time operation status with visual indicators
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and user notification
- **Recovery Logic**: Automatic recovery mechanisms for interrupted operations

**Hook Usage:**
```javascript
const operation = useOperationStatus(30000); // 30 second timeout

operation.startOperation('Processing...');
operation.updateProgress(50, 'Halfway complete');
operation.completeOperation(result, 'Success!');
```

### 3. Auto-Save Functionality

**Features:**
- **Form Draft Saving**: Automatically saves form data to localStorage
- **Recovery on Reload**: Prompts users to restore unsaved drafts
- **Debounced Saving**: Intelligent saving that doesn't overwhelm storage
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators showing save status

**Implementation in Schedule Page:**
- Forms automatically save drafts every 1 second when data changes
- Visual indicators show "Saving draft...", "Draft saved", or "Auto-save enabled"
- On page reload/return, users can choose to restore unsaved work
- Drafts are automatically cleared when successfully submitted

### 4. Enhanced Data Persistence

**Files Modified:**
- `src/context/AppStore.jsx` - Added operation status notifications
- `src/App.jsx` - Integrated global status notifications

**Improvements:**
- **Operation Feedback**: All CRUD operations now provide status feedback
- **Error Reporting**: Clear error messages for failed operations
- **Success Confirmation**: Visual confirmation of successful saves
- **Global Notifications**: Consistent notification system across the app

## Specific Timeout Scenarios Addressed

### 1. Export Operations
- **Problem**: Large datasets could cause browser hangs or timeouts
- **Solution**: Chunked processing with progress indicators and configurable timeouts
- **Recovery**: Operations can be cancelled and resumed, with partial progress saved

### 2. Form Operations
- **Problem**: Users could lose form data if browser crashed or timed out
- **Solution**: Auto-save drafts to localStorage with recovery prompts
- **Recovery**: Automatic draft detection and restoration on page reload

### 3. Data Operations
- **Problem**: No feedback on save status or operation completion
- **Solution**: Real-time status notifications for all operations
- **Recovery**: Clear error messages and retry mechanisms

## User Experience Improvements

### Progress Visibility
- Progress bars for long-running operations
- Real-time status messages
- Estimated completion times
- Cancel options for operations in progress

### Error Handling
- Clear error messages explaining what went wrong
- Suggestions for how to resolve issues
- Automatic retry mechanisms where appropriate
- Data preservation even when operations fail

### Recovery Mechanisms
- Draft restoration prompts
- Progress persistence across sessions
- Automatic cleanup of temporary data
- Clear status about what was/wasn't saved

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. Large Export Test
```javascript
// Create a large dataset and test export
const largeData = Array.from({length: 10000}, (_, i) => ({...}));
await exportToCSV(largeData, 'large-test');
// Should show progress and complete without timeout
```

### 2. Form Recovery Test
1. Start filling out a booking form
2. Close browser/tab before saving
3. Return to page - should prompt to restore draft
4. Verify all entered data is preserved

### 3. Operation Timeout Test
1. Start a long-running operation
2. Simulate network issues or delays
3. Verify timeout handling and user notification
4. Confirm partial progress is saved

## Configuration Options

### Timeout Settings
- Export operations: 60 seconds (configurable)
- Form auto-save: 1 second debounce (configurable)
- Status notifications: 3 second display (configurable)

### Storage Options
- Auto-save uses localStorage with sessionStorage fallback
- Progress data persists across browser sessions
- Automatic cleanup of old drafts and temporary data

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- Real-time sync across multiple tabs
- Cloud-based draft storage for cross-device recovery
- More granular progress tracking for complex operations
- Background processing for very large datasets

### Performance Optimizations
- Web Workers for CPU-intensive operations
- Incremental loading for large datasets
- Compression for stored draft data
- Smart caching of export results

## Summary

This implementation provides comprehensive timeout handling and progress saving that ensures:
1. **No Data Loss**: All user work is automatically preserved
2. **Clear Feedback**: Users always know the status of their operations
3. **Graceful Recovery**: Failed operations can be resumed or recovered
4. **Better UX**: Visual progress indicators and status notifications
5. **Reliability**: Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms

The solution addresses the original concern from issue #11 by ensuring that regardless of timeouts or failures, user progress is always saved and recoverable.
