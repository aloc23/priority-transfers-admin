## 6. File Structure

### New Files Created:
```
src/

- Advanced filtering options (by date range, status, customer)
- Export functionality for calendar events
- Real-time updates and notifications
- Multi-currency support with dynamic conversion rates

### Technical Debt:
- Consider migrating to TypeScript for better type safety
- Implement proper API integration for backend data
- Add comprehensive test suite
- Consider state management with Redux or Zustand for larger datasets
