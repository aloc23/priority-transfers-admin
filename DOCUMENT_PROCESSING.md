# Enhanced Document Upload & Processing Documentation

## üöÄ Smart Document Processing Features

The Priority Transfers Admin system now includes advanced document processing capabilities that can automatically extract expense data from various document types using OCR and intelligent parsing.

### üìã Supported Document Types

#### 1. **PDF Documents**
- **Technology**: PDF.js text extraction
- **Capabilities**: Extracts all text content from PDF files and intelligently parses expense information
- **Use Cases**: Invoice PDFs, receipt PDFs, bank statements
- **Example**: Upload a PDF invoice and the system will automatically detect dates, amounts, and merchant names

#### 2. **Image Files (JPG, PNG, WebP)**
- **Technology**: Tesseract.js OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
- **Capabilities**: Scans images of receipts and extracts text data
- **Use Cases**: Photo receipts, scanned documents, mobile-captured receipts
- **Mobile Support**: Includes camera capture functionality for direct receipt scanning

#### 3. **Structured Data Files**
- **CSV Files**: Direct import with automatic column mapping
- **JSON Files**: Flexible data structure support
- **TXT Files**: Pattern-based expense extraction
- **Excel Files**: Basic support with manual entry fallback

### üîß How It Works

#### Automatic Data Extraction
1. **Upload/Capture**: User uploads document or captures photo
2. **Processing**: System analyzes document using appropriate technology (OCR/text extraction)
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Intelligent parsing looks for:
   - Date patterns (various formats)
   - Currency amounts (‚Ç¨, $, EUR)
   - Merchant/vendor names
   - Expense categories
4. **Auto-categorization**: Expenses are automatically categorized based on merchant names
5. **Global Sync**: Extracted expenses are added to the global expense store and synchronized across all dashboards

#### Smart Pattern Recognition
The system recognizes multiple date formats:
- `YYYY-MM-DD`
- `DD/MM/YYYY`
- `MM/DD/YYYY`
- `DD.MM.YYYY`
- `Jan 15, 2024`

Currency detection supports:
- Euro symbols: `‚Ç¨45.50`, `45.50‚Ç¨`, `EUR 45.50`
- Dollar symbols: `$45.50`, `45.50$`
- Numbers with various decimal separators

### üì± Mobile Receipt Scanning

#### Camera Integration
- **Direct Capture**: Take photos of receipts using device camera
- **OCR Processing**: Automatic text extraction from captured images
- **Touch-friendly**: Optimized for mobile use with large touch targets

#### Usage Instructions
1. Click "Add Expense" button
2. In the expense modal, click "Scan Receipt" (mobile only)
3. Allow camera permissions when prompted
4. Position receipt in camera view
5. Tap "Capture Receipt" button
6. System automatically processes and fills in expense details

### üß† Intelligent Categorization

The system automatically categorizes expenses based on merchant names:

| Category | Keywords |
|----------|----------|
| **Fuel** | shell, bp, esso, texaco, petrol, gas, fuel, station |
| **Food** | restaurant, cafe, coffee, food, pizza, burger, lunch, dinner |
| **Maintenance** | garage, service, repair, parts, tire, oil, mechanic |
| **Office** | office, supplies, paper, ink, stationery, depot |
| **Travel** | hotel, accommodation, booking, travel, flight, train |
| **Parking** | parking, meter, toll, garage |
| **Insurance** | insurance, cover, policy, premium |
| **Telecommunications** | phone, mobile, internet, broadband, vodafone, three |

### üíæ Global Data Synchronization

#### Expense Storage
- **Local Storage**: Expenses are saved to browser local storage for offline access
- **Real-time Updates**: All dashboards and reports update immediately when new expenses are added
- **KPI Integration**: Financial KPIs (total expenses, profit calculations) update automatically
- **Activity Logging**: All expense additions are logged for audit purposes

#### Cross-Component Integration
Processed expenses appear in:
- Main Dashboard expense table
- Financial KPI blocks
- Billing and accounting sections
- Reports and analytics
- Export functions

### üîç Testing the Functionality

#### Sample Files Provided
1. **`sample-receipt.txt`** - Text file with multiple expense entries
2. **`sample-expenses.csv`** - CSV file with properly formatted expense data

#### Testing Steps
1. Navigate to Dashboard ‚Üí Accounting tab
2. Click "Smart Upload" button
3. Select one of the sample files
4. Observe automatic data extraction and table population
5. Check that KPI blocks update with new expense totals

### üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling

#### Fallback Mechanisms
- **OCR Failure**: Manual entry prompt if OCR cannot extract data
- **PDF Processing Error**: Graceful fallback to manual description/amount entry
- **Invalid Files**: Clear error messages for unsupported formats
- **Camera Access**: Appropriate error handling for devices without camera access

#### User Feedback
- **Loading States**: Visual indicators during processing
- **Success Messages**: Confirmation when expenses are successfully extracted
- **Progress Tracking**: OCR progress indicators for long operations
- **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error descriptions

### ‚ö° Performance Considerations

#### Optimization Features
- **Lazy Loading**: Document processor is loaded only when needed
- **File Size Limits**: Reasonable limits to prevent browser crashes
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of large file buffers
- **Background Processing**: Non-blocking operations for better UX

#### Browser Compatibility
- **PDF Processing**: Works in all modern browsers with PDF.js
- **OCR**: Tesseract.js runs in web workers for performance
- **Camera API**: Progressive enhancement for camera features
- **File Upload**: Standard HTML5 file input with drag-and-drop

### üîß Technical Architecture

#### Dependencies
- **PDF.js**: PDF text extraction
- **Tesseract.js**: OCR processing
- **Web Workers**: Background processing for performance
- **File API**: Modern file handling
- **MediaDevices API**: Camera access for mobile scanning

#### Code Structure
- **`documentProcessor.js`**: Main processing engine
- **`ExpenseModal.jsx`**: Enhanced modal with upload/camera features  
- **`Dashboard.jsx`**: Integrated upload functionality
- **Global Store**: Centralized expense management

### üéØ Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
